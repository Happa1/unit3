## Problem definition (Client Identification)
The client, a locan entrepreneur M, opened sustainable candle shop,"Candelique", just a month ago.
Candelique is at the forefront of innovation in the candle industry, blending sustainability with cutting-edge designs. 
Candles in her shop are popular for its sustainability and cute designs, so many customers come every day. 
The more customers come than she expected, and she only uses paper to track the order of candle materials. 
Therefore, sometimes shop staff forget to record the material purchased and many materials run out due to a defective inventory list.
As well as inventory, the track of money is recorded on the paper, and it makes it difficult for her to calculate profit and expenditure of materials.
it is vulnerable in terms of security because it is not clear who purchases materials or takes an order and handles money.
Keeping record inventory and money on paper leads to shop staff more likely to make mistakes, and the balance of money doesn't match due to steal by staff.
Also, there are many materials for the candle and each of them has various sustainability characteristics, producing area, and effects for mental relaxation.
This information is hard for new staff to memorize everything, so she needs the system to refer the description of materials.

(see evidence of consultation in AppendixA)


## Proposed Solution
Considering the client's requirements, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application seems to be best option because it has clear visual which is easy to use.
- mistakes on tracking money on paper
    -> the application keeps track of money of purchase of materials and order by customers and calculate, profit, expenditure and balance by clicking a button(not number typing).
- mistakes on tracking inventory on paper
    ->the application keeps track of the number of materials which changes by the purchase of materials and order by customer. It also shows what kind of materials are lacking. 
- memorization of description of materials
    ->
- running out of inventory due to a lack of analysis of inventory and popularity of candle



## Tools of my solution
By considering the requirements of the client, I decided to use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application for the development. 
GUI application is a desktop application that doesnâ€™t require an Internet connection. 
This allows strong security to protect from application hijacks and makes it easy to improve the application. 
Compared to the GLI (Command Line Interface) application, the GUI application has good visual elements, so people who are not familiar with programming can easily use it.
For a programming language, I decided to use Python. 
Python includes a wide range of libraries and frameworks, so I can develop user interfaces, databases, and backend programs in one language. 
Python is also a well-known language, so the client asks for further improvement from other developers to update the application in the future. 
For the development, I needed a database to record data, and I chose SQLite as a database that provides a relational database management system. 
I developed a desktop application that works well with SQLite which uses local data sources. We can set hash-check for SQLite database, so it ensures higher security different from the Google spreadsheet. 
In addition, SQLite is faster than other files and more reliable.

| 4       | ER diagram                  | I created an ER diagram to figure out the data that I needed to collect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 30                  | Feb 18                 | B        |
| 5       | UML diagram                 | I drew a UML diagram of a relational database to visualize the relationship of each table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 30                  | Feb 14                 | B        |
| 6       | Sketch                      | I created a Sketch of a GUI application to propose to my client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 60                  | Feb 18                 | B        |
| 7       | Home Screen                 | I created a signup button and a login button which move to different pages by click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 20                  | Feb 22                 | C        |
| 8       | Sign Up                     | I created a signup function that records username and hash made from username and password into the table user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 40                  | Feb 26                 | C        |
| 9       | Login                       | I created a login function which validate the inputted username and password by using hash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 30                  | Mar 3                  | C        |
| 10      | Menu                        | I created menu screen and 6 buttons which moves to different pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 40                  | Mar 3                  | C        |
| 11      | Take Order (order)          | I created a take-order screen by using MDDropItemList. Lists take ingredients data from the inventory table and display as drop-down lists. It allows customers to choose ingredients from the list and record chosen ingredients into the table orders.                                                                                                                       | 120                 | Mar 3                  | C        |
| 12      | Order Check (check)         | I created an order-check screen by using MDDatatable by referring orders table and the button that guides the user to move to purchase candles. After a user presses the payment button, the number of used ingredients is subtracted from the amount in the inventory table, and record orders in the order-history. Also, the profit will be recorded into the ledger table. | 90                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
| 13      | Success Order               | I created a success-order which displays the order done successfully and guides user to the menu page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 15                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
| 14      | Order History               | I created a order history table which displays the past order of candles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 40                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
| 15      | Inventory (inventory)       | I created an inventory table and added functions which allows user to select ingredients by checkbox and input the amount they want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 70                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
| 16      | Inventory Order (purchase)  | I created an inventory-order screen in which the user can see the ingredients that they want to purchase. After the user presses purchase button, the purchased ingredients are added to the amount of inventory. Also, the expenditure will be recorded in the table ledger.                                                                                                  | 40                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
| 17      | Ledger                      | I created a ledger screen that displays the ledger table. Also the descending and ascending button allows the user to flip the order of the ledger based on date.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 40                  | Mar 4                  | C        |
