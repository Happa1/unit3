# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition (Client Identification)
The client, a locan entrepreneur M, opened sustainable candle shop,"Candelique", just a month ago.
Candelique is at the forefront of innovation in the candle industry, blending sustainability with cutting-edge designs. 
Candles in her shop are popular for its sustainability and cute designs, so many customers come every day. 
The more customers come than she expected, and she only uses paper to track the order of candle materials. 
Therefore, sometimes shop staff forget to record the material purchased and many materials run out due to a defective inventory list.
As well as inventory, the track of money is recorded on the paper, and it makes it difficult for her to calculate profit and expenditure of materials.
it is vulnerable in terms of security because it is not clear who purchases materials or takes an order and handles money.
Keeping record inventory and money on paper leads to shop staff more likely to make mistakes, and the balance of money doesn't match due to steal by staff.
Also, there are many materials for the candle and each of them has various sustainability characteristics, producing area, and effects for mental relaxation.
This information is hard for new staff to memorize everything, so she needs the system to refer the description of materials.

(see evidence of consultation in AppendixA)


## Proposed Solution
Considering the client's requirements, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application seems to be best option because it has clear visual which is easy to use.
- mistakes on tracking money on paper
    -> the application keeps track of money of purchase of materials and order by customers and calculate, profit, expenditure and balance by clicking a button(not number typing).
- mistakes on tracking inventory on paper
    ->the application keeps track of the number of materials which changes by the purchase of materials and order by customer. It also shows what kind of materials are lacking. 
- memorization of description of materials
    ->
- running out of inventory due to a lack of analysis of inventory and popularity of candle
